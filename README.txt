I have provided a number of worked MATLAB examples for Thermodynamics and other engineering problems that typically arise in the Chemical/Mechanical/Material Science realms. Most of these templates can be modified for any problem.
For instance, changing the boundary layer conditions of the functions I provided can accomodate a number of systems). These topics were tailored for Graduate and Advanced Undergraduates classes, as well as projects in the field.
